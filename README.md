## Development 

### Releases 

We use [`npm`](https://npmjs.com) for releases. In particular, we use
`npm --publish` to get the job done.

Currently, only @thinkjrs has the ability to release. The following section 
is written for memory.

#### Release prep

Prior to using `npm --publish` a release tag needs to be created for
the library using our standard tagging practices. 

> Ensure that tests :white_check_mark: pass during this process prior to
releasing via npm.

##### Test release 

To do a proper release, ensure you're in the base repo directory and run 
`npm publish . --access public --dry-run`.

#### Release `latest` tag

To complete a full release to the `latest` npm `dist-tag`, ensure you're in
the base repo directory and run `npm publish . --access public`.
